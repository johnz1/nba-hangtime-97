- Smoke and shadown trails were planned, and in debug stage.

In plyr.axx behind .if debug near 'start animate'

;slousmk	CREATE0	plyr_smoketrail

in plyr3, behind if 0 (disabled)

plyr_smoketrail 	(15 puffs)
plyr_smoketrail2 	(20 puffs?)

plyr_smokepuff

if enabled it needs CLDB1ORNG which is in imgtbl.asm and .glo so already in 
the GFX assets, but unused. (We can compile now.)

Testing shows a garbled bunch of gfx on all dunks now. :)

These are loaded in misc.lod at irw image creation.
CLDB1WHT,CLDB1ORNG,CLDB1LGRY,CLDB1GRN,CLDB1PURP
They're old images from Jam.

smoke_t was reused for the ball trails when on fire / team fire etc.
so the puff routine starts with the wrong image/pal and it looks bad.

Fixed it by starting with SMOK1_01 but it looks wierd, animation table
might be wrong for the routine as it's from Jam.

Can be toggled in SYS.EQU now.
