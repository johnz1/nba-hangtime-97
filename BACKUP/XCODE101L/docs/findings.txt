Almost same as normal hang, but with hotspots, 

IMGPAL4.ASM must include handcrafted IMGTBL4.GLO otherwise it won't build text.asm

VS_G_P in select3 is not in normal gfx files for L1.3
it comes from BBMISC.LOD's IMGPAL.ASM/AXX so that was regenerated. See img*.bat in the IMG folder.
Also IMGTBL.GLO needs this as a .global instead of VS_Y_P. It's just a palette change. no irw's change from this.
