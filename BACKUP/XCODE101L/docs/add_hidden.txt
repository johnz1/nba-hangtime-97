How to add a hidden player
==========================

- Make sure all the assets are in place and generated by the lod. This is semi-automated.
- All the tables mentioned below like 'our_heads' are sequential and data MUST be in the same
  spot and tables should be exact same amount of entries, or game will crash!

Example: Raiden
Mugshot			RAD_MK2
Heads:			RAIDEN0*
Nameplate:		RAIDEN
Full Name sound:	0b50h
Pass sound: 		tbd
Player data		actual player stat

Mugshot
=======
This goes in select2.axx in the 'our_heads' table. Look for the marker at the end, below "EMURDOCK"

Nameplate
=========
This goes in select2.axx in the 'our_names' table. Look for the marker at the end, below "EMURDOCK"

Full Name sound
===============
Used when the player is selected with his code. 
This goes in 'zpsjteam_snds' table. Look for the marker at the end, below "MURDOCK, eric"
You add the sound calls into DCS\rebuild.scr

Pin code
========
Used to unlock this player for selection.
This goes in zpsjteam_data1. Look for the marker at the end. Add like this:

 .word	R_,A_,I_,D_,E_,N_
 .word	ZER,ZER,ZER,ZER 	;test,     raiden mk2

You can look in the entries above to use other digits for codes.

Heads
=====
The actual player heads. There are two options, a simple 5-head variant, or a deluxe 16-head angle variant.
Hangtime uses 16 where possible.

For hiddens, these are stored in plyrat3.axx. You'll add a .def there to define it, so other .axx files
can then .ref to it.

.def	raiden_h

raiden_h
	HDMAC	RAIDEN01 ; 16 heads, deluxe

Player data
===========
The actual player data, like his stats, colors, size and which heads to use.

For hiddens, these are stored in plyrat.axx in the spechds_t table. Look for the marker below "E. MURDOCK"

; Raiden in white & black
	LWWWWWW	scale610_t,BV8,SHT11,DNK10,DEF8,SDEF6,DSKL_5	;Can shatter
	.long	NFL55_p, UN_BOSS_P,UN_BOSS_P, TR_SANS_P,TR_SANS_P,raiden_h
	.word	2,3,8,17
	.long	SW_PORS_P,SW_PORS_P,VP_PORS_P,VP_PORS_P		

Speech
======
In-match speech is different from the select screen sample, and is stored in speech.axx.
You should look for the table "special_name_speech" and the marker below MURDOCK, ERIC

;AMM Add full name (is this a single sample for hiddens w/ no full name?)
 .word	0100DH,45,0B50h ;Raiden

The same goes for the table "special_pass_speech" where you will add the "to raiden" sample. 
(You could save some space here by simply recycling the same sound call.)

Various
=======
File "PAL.AXX" should have the nameplate pal .def in there. Look for the marker at the start of the file.
