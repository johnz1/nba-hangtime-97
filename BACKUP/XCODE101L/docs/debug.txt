SYS.EQU
DEBUG	.equ 0/1
================

From BB.ASM:

- If stick held up at start, show outdoor court
- If pass button is pressed at start, allow rim-detect single-stepping.
This enables slow-mo dunks to check the dunks/rim alignment etc.
- If turbo button is pressed at start, turn off clock
- If shoot button is pressed at start, skip initials & go to game

All of these start a 4-player game w/ powerups.

Tested & Works in Hangtime

SYS.EQU
IMGVIEW	.equ 0/1
================

BB.AXX has a CREATE0 anipts_debug which checks the value in a8

From BB2.ASM: 

;Debug
;Display each frame of our ball player to check 2nd and 3rd ani pnts, etc.
;Re-insert these lines when tweaking ani points

checks 'butn_minus and butn_plus' for inputs. Looks like older JAM code since it's not using 
@_switch_addr or @_switch2_addr? (@SWITCH was the old unsecured i/o code from JAM.)	
Could be wrong, maybe it's unused buttons we don't have in emulation. 
Could be we need some ani list as well, debug1 and debug2 look pretty empty.
Probably best to investigate how it functions in JAM if debug works there too.

VOLDN   .equ    11
VOLUP	.equ	12

butn_minus
	.long	12,12,12,6
butn_plus
	.long	14,14,14,13

Should normally be done like this.

	move	@_coin_addr,a0,L
	move	*a0,a0
	btst	VOLDN,a0
	jrz	drxvvoldn_loop (it's pressed when 0)

There are some imgs in debug_img_list

SYS.EQU
HEADCK	.equ 0/1
================		
Should be used together with DEBUG.
- Displays player names (select2.asm)
- Stops the clock (score.asm)
- Wants "debug_plyr_num" which is set in?? (bb.asm, defined in plyr.asm)
- I've set it to '91' for now which is CHEANEY on Washington.

I think this symbol could be set with the TODDVIEW debugger.
Problem is our symbol map doesn't generate. Maybe hardcode a number?

We can
- Hardcode "debug_plyr_num" in bb.asm
- Last player in normal tbl is '090h' aka CHEANEY from Washington.
- PLYRAT.AXX has a table below there with entries for more: search for CUST_1t
- Add your custom doofus_h heads there and debug with it.
- DEBUG=1, HEADCK=1. Hold SHOT when pressing 1p start to start a game.
- Now you can get most of the head angles fixed. :)
- Probably best to set to 2P cabinet for easy control as you get the ball at start.

Most of these also trigger with DEBUG = 1

Court dots feature commented near end, untested.
