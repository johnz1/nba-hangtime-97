This conf used for linking the game. It needs the older 5.10 linker and symbol map disabled.
Works for 2023.10.6

Dosbox-ECE.conf is used with Dosbox-ECE (i used r4482) and might work with the normal Dosbox release.
It works for managing gfx data with IT.EXE and you can use QEMM vidram on/off tricks to get more ram.
