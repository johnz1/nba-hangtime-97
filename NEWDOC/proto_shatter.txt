As stated by some online sources i can't find right now, there was shatter in the proto versions of Hangtime.

In the leaks, there are various development IMG containers with the following:

HOOPO.IMG
BBORD_1 -> BBORD_10 -> The shattering board anim.
BTURN_1 -> BTURN_5 -> angles of the shattered board.
SHARD_1 -> SHARD8 -> Collections of glass shards for when the board shatters.
SHAT1_* -> Exploding glass

The effect seems a lot more elaborate than in JAM.
